Using PowerBI and R studio to do an EDA on a superstore dataset
## Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings:
Sales across all time periods shows a strong trend of seasonality with sales peaking in December and dropping by about 70% in January. The technology sector generates the highest number of sales in any category and sector although it has the lowest order count. Amongst, the technology sector, mobile phones make up the majority of the revenue by 40%.
Although the business has a high customer retention rate of 0.98 which means 98% of customers who have bought an item before has gone to purchase another item in the future, the number of new customers has been decreasing drastically over time.
In this report, we will explore the data and find the cause or ways to attract new customers overtime.

### Sales Trends:
•	The seasonality pattern is shown across all sectors, consumer, corporate and home office which indicates increased spending on holidays such as black Fridays in November purchases and Christmas in December. 

•	There’s a positive trend in sales as sales go up on average £1,200–1,500 per month across 2015–2018. This equates to an approximate £15K–18K annual growth.

•	Despite having the lowest amount of orders, the technology sector has the highest sales of £830k compared to Furniture and Office Supplies with sales of £728k and £705k respectively. 

•	There seems to be a spike in technology purchases around March, unexplained by our previous findings and diving deeper into the data, it looks like the spike is more present in the home office and consumer line. In many markets, March is the end of a Fiscal year, and small businesses and individuals often make last minute purchases to claim tax deductions. This aligns with bulk buying of machines, accessories and office supplies, which could explain the spike in March sales.
